                    </div>
                    <p>Christine emerged triumphant from a very long fistfight sporting a Pinteresque keeker applied in instalments during her formative years. She then decided to build a cathedral and could have used film, paint or the printed word, but she chose music and went off to fight amongst the Northern Lights.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Edward Mitchell Bannister was a Black Canadian-American Tonalist painter. He was born on November 2, 1828, St. Andrews, Canada. Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly pastoral subject matter were drawn from his admiration for Millet and the French Barbizon School.</p>
